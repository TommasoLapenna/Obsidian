An aircraft (in general) is free to rotate in three dimensions. These rotations are produced by torques (or moments) about the principal axes

- **Vertical Axis (Yaw):** The yaw axis has its origin at the center of gravity and is directed towards the bottom of the aircraft. Motion about thus axis is called *Yaw*
- **Lateral Axis (Pitch):** The pitch axis passes through form an end to another. Rotation about this axis is called *Pitch*.
- **Longitudinal Axis (Roll)**: The roll axis has its origin at the center of gravity and is directed forward. Motion about thus axis is called *Roll*.
A Quadcopter has 4 degrees of freedom (independent factors that can be assesed)
