### Electromotive Force (EMF)
The EMF $\varepsilon$ is an energy transfer to an electric circuit per unit of electric charge, measured in volts. Devices called electrical transducer provade an emf by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy. Other types of electrical equipment  can generate electrical energy, such as batteries (by converting chemical energy) and generators (by converting mechanical energy). This energy is achieved by physical forces applying physical work on electric charges.
In electromagnetic induction, EMF can be defined around a closed loop of a  conductor as the electromagnetic work that would be done on an elementary electric charge (electron) if it travels once around the loop.

In a battery, the charge separation that gives rise to the potential difference (voltage) between the terminals is accomplished by chemical reactions at the electrodes that convert chemical potential energy into electromagnetic potential energy.

In s device without internal resistence, if an electric charge $q$ passing through that device gains an energy $W$ via work, the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit charge $$\varepsilon= \frac{W}{Q}$$and it is mesured in $\frac{j}{C}$
### Counter Electromotive Force (or Back EMF)
The counter EMF is the electromotive force manifesting as a voltage that opposes the change in current which induced it. Counter EMF is the EMF caused by electromagnetic induction.
The term back EMF is used to refer to the voltage that occurs in electric motors, where there is relative motion between the armature and the magnetic field produced by the motor's field coils or permanent magnet field, thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor. This effect is not due to the motor's inductance (Faraday's law), but a separate phenomenon
This voltage is n series with and opposes the original applied voltage, with lower overall voltage and as the motor turns faster, the current flowing into the motor decreases. 
By using back EMF it is possible to mesure the motor speed and position, as the back EMF is proportional to the rotational speed of the armature
