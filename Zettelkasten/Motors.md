# Naming
Example:
- **A2212 1000kV 12N14P**
	- A2212: 22 is the diameter of the stator in millimeters, 12 is the height of the motor itself or the stator in millimiters.
	- 1000 kV: is the motor velocity constant, so in this case the motor will spin 1000 rpm for every one volt. A motor with lower kV will spin at lower rpm, but will have more torque.
	- 12N14P: 12 is the number if electromagnets/coils the stator has and 14 is how many permanent magnets are on the rotor
# Theory
All the motors have two parts: 
- **Rotor:** the part that spins
- Stator: the part that stays in place
Motors are also divided in two main classes:
- **Brushed:** they have two wires and generally have the coils on the rotor and the magnets on the stator. When the coils are energised, it will create a magnetic field that will attract or repel the magnets on the stator, causing the motor to spin. The coils get the energy through "brushes" and as the rotor spins, the direction of the electric flow will change accordingly ![[Pasted image 20250118105000.jpg]]
- **Brushless:** they have three wires and, due to its structure, cannot run directly off the battery. Their structure is the opposite of the brushed ones (magnets on the rotor and coils on the stator). In this case the poles of the electromagnet no longer filp with the rotation of the rotor, so a component called *Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)* is necessary. The main job of an ESC is to turn on and off the coils in a timed manner in order to keep the motor running. ![[Pasted image 20250118105341.png]]
Brushed motors are generally cheaper, but they spin slower and are less efficient due to the friction generated by the brushes and the rotor. Brushless motor are instead much faster and efficient and their speed depends on the ESC, and of course they are more expensive.

## Torque
Torque is the rotational analogue of linear force. It is also referred to as the *Momentum of Force* (in this case it is denoted by $M$).
Just as a linear force is a push or a pull applied to a body, a torque can be thought of as a twist applied to an object with respect to a chosen point. Ot is mesured in $N\cdot m$ $$\tau= r\times F$$
## Constants
### $K_M$ (Motor Size Constant)
The motor constant is expressed in $\frac{N\cdot m}{\sqrt{W}}$ $$K_M= \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{P}}$$where:
- $\tau$ is the motor torque ($n\cdot m$)
- $P$ is the resistive power loss ($W$)
The motor constant is winding independent.
### $K_V$ (Motor Velocity Constant)
The motor velocity constant  is expressed in $RPM\cdot V$ or $\frac{rad}{V\cdot s}$ $$K_V=\frac{\omega_{no-load}}{V_{peak}}$$The $K_V$ rating od a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded rotational speed to the peak voltage on the wires connected to the coils.
The motor may not reach this theoretical speed because there are non-linear mechanical losses.

$K_M$ can be used for selecting the size of the motor to use in an application, $K_V$ can be use fro selecting the winding to use in the moto
### $K_T$ (Motor Torque Constant)
The motor torque constant is the torque produced divided by aramture current and it is expressed in $N\cdot \frac{m}{A}$
## Components
### Armature 
The armature is the winding of an electrical machine which carries alternating current. The armature windings conduct AC even on DC machines, due to the commutator action or due to electronic commutation (in brushless motors). 
The armature can be either in the rotor or the stator.
![[Pasted image 20250118153551.jpg]]
The armature windings interact with the magnetic field in the air-gap the magnetic field is generated either by permanent magnets, or electromagnets formed by a conducting coil. 
The armature must carry current, so it is always a conductor or a conductive coil, oriented normal to both the field and the direction of motion, torque or force.
The armature's role is twofold:
- Creating a shaft toque in a rotating machine or force in a linear machine
- Generate an EMF
In the armature, an electromotive force is created by the relative motion of the itself and the field: when the motor is used, the EMF generated opposes the armature current and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power in the form of torque, that is then transfer via the shaft. 
When it is used as a generator, the machine has a different behaviour.
