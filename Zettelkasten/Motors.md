All the motors have two parts: 
- **Rotor:** the part that spins
- Stator: the part that stays in place
Motors are also divided in two main classes:
- **Brushed:** they have two wires and generally have the coils on the rotor and the magnets on the stator. When the coils are energised, it will create a magnetic field that will attract or repel the magnets on the stator, causing the motor to spin. The coils get the energy through "brushes" and as the rotor spins, the direction of the electric flow will change accordingly ![[Pasted image 20250118105000.jpg]]
- **Brushless:** they have three wires and, due to its structure, cannot run directly off the battery. Their structure is the opposite of the brushed ones (magnets on the rotor and coils on the stator). In this case the poles of the electromagnet no longer filp with the rotation of the rotor, so a component called *Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)* is necessary. The main job of an ESC is to turn on and off the coils in a timed manner in order to keep the motor running. ![[Pasted image 20250118105341.png]]
Brushed motors are generally cheaper, but they spin slower and are less efficient due to the friction generated by the brushes and the rotor. Brushless motor are instead much faster and efficient and their speed depends on the ESC, and of course they are more expensive.
