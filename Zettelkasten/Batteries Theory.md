# Naming
Example:
- **3s 2000 mAH 20c**
	- 3s: is how may cells are wired in series and parallel
	- 2000 mAH: is the capacity of the battery, it means how much electricity it can supply before it dies. By dividing this number by 1000 multiplying it by the c rating the maximum number of amps the battery can supply before damage is obtained.
	- 20c: is the c rating, it represents the maximum amount of amps that the battery can supply. The burst c rating can be calculated from this
- **BEC**: is the Battery Eliminator Circuit
