The frame is a stuccature in which all other parts of the drone fit, functioning as a skeleton and it makes up 90% of a quadcopter. 
The size is measured so that it represents the approximate diagonal arm span of the drone in millimetres. The smaller the frame, the more agile the drone will be, at the expense of stability and viceversa.

	- Carbon

There are three main types of quadcopter frames: X, H and + frames (there are also other less popolar types).
- X frame
	The classic drone frame, the arms are at right angles to each other.

- H frame
	Mainly used on racing drones, the main advantage of this configuration is that there is more room for electronics and batteries.

- + frame
	Virtually identical to the X frame, but has a different orientation when flying. This configuration is not commonly used because the arms block the camera view
