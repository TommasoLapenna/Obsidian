LiPo batteries consist of individual cells, each with a nominal voltage of 3.7 V, the number of cell and total voltage is indicated on the label. 
A LiPo battery cell is to be chared and dischareged within a specific voltage: 4.2V (fully charged) - 3.0V (fully dischareged). Staying between these limits is important in order to respectively fires or irreversible performance damage.
