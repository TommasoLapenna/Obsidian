The remote controller function is to realize real-time wireless communication between the pilot and the drone. this depends on stable and reliable radio wave transmission between the transmitter and the receiver. 
The receiver has to receives the radio signals, demodulate them  and decode them. These signals are then further processed and converted into commands for the different components of the UAV.
# Commands
A drone's remote control contains multiple control channels, each corresponding to an action on a control axis
- The *Right Stick* is used to control the roll and pitch of the drone (right/left, forward/backwards)
- The *Right Stick* is used to control the yaw and throttle of the drone (height and rotation)
